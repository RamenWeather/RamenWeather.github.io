				In the depths of the coldest months it becomes impossible to leave your house. You know that your walls and your front door are the only thing separating you from the biting chill of the winter winds. Every single human individually isolated in their hermetic chambers, praying for better days to come when something good will finally happen. In these moments we all collectively dream of soup. Big hot pots of communal broth to gather around like fireplaces of old. In this dream, everyone we love is there, to share in the glowing moments of Ramen Weather.

				In the bleakest moments of strife it becomes impossible to think about anyone else. You work endless hours at a thankless job that pays out less than you put in. When you finally get to come home you’re too exhausted to think about anything other than lying down. You’re too hungry to sleep but too tired to cook, you order in even though you hate yourself for paying more than you can afford for food that gives a momentary satisfaction. Every one of us is trapped dreaming of the day when something good will finally happen. In these moments we dream of noodles. Big thick chewy noodles to share with friends. If we all work together to make them then we all get to work together to eat them. Love and laughter and kisses are the respite of Ramen Weather.

				In the time after a loved one leaves, the heart doesn’t know how to grieve. You become still as the world washes over you. Everything you thought you knew about the world is now different and you can never stop crying. You can’t remember the last time you ate, it’s been days. Every person has or will known pain that they can’t handle alone. In these moments, if we’re lucky, a glowing friend will come to us with a plate of pork, or fatty tuna, or tofu outstretched. Something hearty to heal the heart. With mouths full and arm in arm, we can find the path forward despite the Ramen Weather.

				Here at Ramen Weather we want to share the dream of Ramen Weather. We may not make the world a better place, but we can at least share some hot meals while we’re trying.
